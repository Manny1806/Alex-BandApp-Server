Led by local promoter Brent Stockton, a dedicated group of volunteers have invested time and energy into creating a non-profit center that magically blends visual art with performing art in an open and inviting atmosphere. Appropriately named Vangarde Arts, this group is leading the way and exploring new boundaries for the arts, adding to the already growing cultural district in downtown Sioux City. The gallery lounge and intimate listening room create a wonderful space for patrons to enjoy the social and educational value of original art forms.",
